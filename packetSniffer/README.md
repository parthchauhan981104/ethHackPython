Packet sniffing is the practice of gathering, collecting, and logging some or 
all packets that pass through a computer network, regardless of how the packet 
is addressed. In this way, every packet, or a defined subset of packets, may 
be gathered for further analysis.

Run this in parallel with arp spoofer script in separate terminal tabs. So we can
sniff packets that were meant to be received by the victim.

test it using a website which uses simple http like http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
