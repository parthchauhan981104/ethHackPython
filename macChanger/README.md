A MAC address is a hardware identification number that uniquely identifies 
each device on a network. ... For this reason, MAC addresses are made up 
of six two-digit hexadecimal numbers, separated by colons.

Unlike devices on the internet, devices in the LAN don’t communicate directly 
via IP addresses. Instead, they use physical hardware addresses for addressing 
in local IPv4 networks. These MAC addresses are unique 48-bit numbers, and make 
it possible to identify each device in the LAN via its network card.

The “ifconfig” command is used for displaying current network configuration 
information, setting up an ip address, netmask or broadcast address to a 
network interface, creating an alias for network interface, setting up 
hardware address and enable or disable network interfaces.
